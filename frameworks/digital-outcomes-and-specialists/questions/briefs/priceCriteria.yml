    label: Fixed price
    description: >
      Choosing a fixed price approach means that the supplier owns most of the risk. They’re contractually bound 
      to provide all the work you specify in each particular ‘statement of work’ within the stated timeframe. 
      The supplier may charge more for owning more of the risk. A fixed price approach works best when the requirement
       is well defined so the supplier can provide an accurate quote without incorporating extra costs.

    label: Time and materials
    description: >
      A time and materials approach means you own more of the risk. The supplier can send a pricing matrix showing 
      how long they need to provide the work. If it takes longer to do the work defined in a statement of work, you 
      will be charged on a day rate and expenses basis.
  -
    label: Capped time and materials
    description: >
      A capped time and materials approach is the same as a time and materials approach but there’s a limit on how
      much you have to pay for the work. If you reach the limit before the work is finished, the supplier has to
      complete the work at their own cost. If the supplier finishes the work before they said they would, you only
      pay them for time they took to do the work.
