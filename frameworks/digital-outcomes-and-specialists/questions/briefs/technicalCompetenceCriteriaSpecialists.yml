question: Technical competence criteria
question_advice: |
  Technical competence is how well the supplier can do the work you need them to do.

  Evaluate specialists’ technical competence using criteria for:

  - essential skills and experience
  - nice-to-have skills and experience

  **Giving points for individual criteria (optional)**<br />
  You can give points to individual criteria, eg ‘have experience designing services for users with low digital literacy – 15 points’. If you choose to add points, you must do it for all individual criteria.

  The points you give for essential skills and experience and proposal criteria must be higher than the points for nice-to-have skills and experience criteria.
