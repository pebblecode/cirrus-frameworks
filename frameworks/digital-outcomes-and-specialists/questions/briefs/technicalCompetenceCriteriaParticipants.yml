name: Technical competence criteria
question: Technical competence criteria
question_advice: |
  You must assess a supplier’s technical competence by reviewing their:

  - essential skills and experience
  - nice-to-have skills and experience
  - proposal

  If you want to score individual criteria, you must add points for all:

  - essential skills and experience 
  - nice-to-have skills and experience
  - proposal criteria

  The points you give for nice-to-have skills and experience must be lower than the points you give to the supplier’s essential skills and experience and proposal.
