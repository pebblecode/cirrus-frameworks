question: Technical competence criteria
question_advice: |
  Technical competence is how well the supplier can do the work you need them to do.

  Evaluate suppliers’ technical competence using criteria for:

  - essential skills and experience
  - nice-to-have skills and experience
  - proposal

  **Scoring (optional)**<br />


  If you want to score individual criteria, you must add points for everything. Read [how to score individual criteria](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-set-your-evaluation-criteria-when-buying-digital-outcomes-and-specialists-services#giving-points-to-individual-criteria).

  The points you give for nice-to-have skills and experience must be lower than the points you give to the supplier’s essential skills and experience and proposal.
