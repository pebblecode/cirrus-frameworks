question: Technical competence criteria
question_advice: |
  Technical competence is how well the supplier can do the work you need them to do.

  Evaluate suppliers’ technical competence using criteria for:

  - essential skills and experience
  - nice-to-have skills and experience
  - proposal

  If you want to score criteria individually, you must add points for everything.

  The points you give for nice-to-have skills and experience must be lower than the points you give to the supplier’s essential skills and experience and proposal.
