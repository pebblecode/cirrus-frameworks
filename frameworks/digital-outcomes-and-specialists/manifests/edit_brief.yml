  name: Shortlist and evaluation process
  editable: True
  step: 2

    There are 3 stages to finding the supplier that best meets your needs:

    **1\. View suppliers who applied**<br />
    When suppliers apply they declare which of your ‘essential’ and ‘nice-to-have’ skills and experience they have. Suppliers who don’t meet your essential skills and experience are excluded.

    **2\. Create a shortlist**<br />
    Once you have a list of eligible suppliers, you must shortlist the suppliers who:

    - have the most ‘nice-to-have’ skills and experience
    - can start when you need them

    You may need to ask for evidence of skills and experience if you have too many suppliers.


    **3\. Evaluate your shortlist**<br />
    Ask the shortlisted suppliers for: 

      - evidence of their skills and experience
      - a proposal explaining how they’ll deliver your requirements

    You must tell suppliers how you’ll evaluate and assess them.

  name: Describe question and answer session
  editable: True
  step: 3
  description: |
    While the application period is open, you need to reply to all questions suppliers ask about your requirements.

    When a supplier asks a question, you’ll be sent an email to the email address you registered with.

    You’ll need to post all questions and answers on the Digital Marketplace so that all suppliers can see them.

    Providing a question and answer session means you can explain your needs and answer any questions quickly.
